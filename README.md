# Traffic-Airline-Analyzer
This data visualization tool aims to give a general visualization of the commercial flights routes regarding the world airports. This idea is extended by considering whole country and their departure flights. The tool is intended to make inferences regarding airports, countries, airlines used and population choices as well. The idea is to divide this knowledge with 4 main visualization which can interactively triggered. One for an  explorable world map, one for an airlines barplot, a world heatmap and finally, obtaining through dimensionality reduction, a scatterplot to inspect how airports, or country, get cauterized and study what similar properties they shares. The visual application makes possible to a normal user to discover information and insights about commercial flights and to give an overall perspective on where citizens of the world prefer to move.
